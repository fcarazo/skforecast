class ForecasterAutoregMultiVariate(ForecasterBase):
    """
    This class turns any regressor compatible with the scikit-learn API into a
    autoregressive multivariate direct multi-step forecaster. A separate model 
    is created for each forecast time step. See documentation for more details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    regressor : regressor or pipeline compatible with the scikit-learn API
        An instance of a regressor or pipeline compatible with the scikit-learn API.
    level : str
        Name of the time series to be predicted.
    steps : int
        Maximum number of future steps the forecaster will predict when using
        method `predict()`. Since a different model is created for each step,
        this value must be defined before training.
    lags : int, list, numpy ndarray, range, dict, default `None`
        Lags used as predictors. Index starts at 1, so lag 1 is equal to t-1.

        - `int`: include lags from 1 to `lags` (included).
        - `list`, `1d numpy ndarray` or `range`: include only lags present in 
        `lags`, all elements must be int.
        - `dict`: create different lags for each series. {'series_column_name': lags}.
        - `None`: no lags are included as predictors. 
    window_features : object, list, default `None`
        Instance or list of instances used to create window features. Window features
        are created from the original time series and are included as predictors.
    transformer_series : transformer (preprocessor), dict, default `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler`
        An instance of a transformer (preprocessor) compatible with the scikit-learn
        preprocessing API with methods: fit, transform, fit_transform and 
        inverse_transform. Transformation is applied to each `series` before training 
        the forecaster. ColumnTransformers are not allowed since they do not have 
        inverse_transform method.

        - If single transformer: it is cloned and applied to all series. 
        - If `dict` of transformers: a different transformer can be used for each series.
    transformer_exog : transformer, default `None`
        An instance of a transformer (preprocessor) compatible with the scikit-learn
        preprocessing API. The transformation is applied to `exog` before training the
        forecaster. `inverse_transform` is not available when using ColumnTransformers.
    weight_func : Callable, default `None`
        Function that defines the individual weights for each sample based on the
        index. For example, a function that assigns a lower weight to certain dates.
        Ignored if `regressor` does not have the argument `sample_weight` in its `fit`
        method. The resulting `sample_weight` cannot have negative values.
    fit_kwargs : dict, default `None`
        Additional arguments to be passed to the `fit` method of the regressor.
    n_jobs : int, 'auto', default `'auto'`
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. If `-1`, then the number of jobs is 
        set to the number of cores. If 'auto', `n_jobs` is set using the function
        skforecast.utils.select_n_jobs_fit_forecaster.
    forecaster_id : str, int, default `None`
        Name used as an identifier of the forecaster.

        as a copy of `regressor`.
    steps : int
        Number of future steps the forecaster will predict when using method
        `predict()`. Since a different model is created for each step, this value
        should be defined before training.

        differentiation is used, `window_size` is increased by n units equal to 
        the order of differentiation so that predictors can be generated correctly.

        An instance of a transformer (preprocessor) compatible with the scikit-learn
        preprocessing API with methods: fit, transform, fit_transform and

        Order of differencing applied to the time series before training the 
        forecaster.
    differentiator : TimeSeriesDifferentiator

    differentiator_ : dict
        Dictionary with the `differentiator` for each series. It is created cloning the
        objects in `differentiator` and is used internally to avoid overwriting.
    last_window_ : pandas DataFrame
        This window represents the most recent data observed by the predictor
        during its training phase. It contains the values needed to predict the

        or differentiation. When `differentiation` parameter is specified, the
        dimensions of the `last_window_` are expanded as many values as the order
        of differentiation. For example, if `lags` = 7 and `differentiation` = 1,
        `last_window_` will have 8 values.
    index_type_ : type

        Parameters
        ----------
        steps : int, list, None, default `None`
            Predict n steps. The value of `steps` must be less than or equal to the 
            value of steps defined when initializing the forecaster. Starts at 1.
        
            - If `int`: Only steps within the range of 1 to int are predicted.
            - If `list`: List of ints. Only the steps contained in the list 
            are predicted.
            - If `None`: As many steps are predicted as were defined at 
            initialization.
        last_window : pandas DataFrame, default `None`
            Series values used to create the predictors (lags) needed to 
            predict `steps`.
            If `last_window = None`, the values stored in` self.last_window_` are
            used to calculate the initial predictors, and the predictions start
            right after training data.
        exog : pandas Series, pandas DataFrame, default `None`
            Exogenous variable/s included as predictor/s.
        interval : list, default `[5, 95]`
            Confidence of the prediction interval estimated. Sequence of 
            percentiles to compute, which must be between 0 and 100 inclusive. 
            For example, interval of 95% should be as `interval = [2.5, 97.5]`.
        n_boot : int, default `250`
            Number of bootstrapping iterations used to estimate predictions.
        random_state : int, default `123`
            Sets a seed to the random generator, so that boot predictions are always 
            deterministic.
        use_in_sample_residuals : bool, default `True`
            If `True`, residuals from the training data are used as proxy of
            prediction error to create predictions. If `False`, out of sample 
            residuals are used. In the latter case, the user should have
            calculated and stored the residuals within the forecaster (see
            `set_out_sample_residuals()`).
        suppress_warnings : bool, default `False`
            If `True`, skforecast warnings will be suppressed during the prediction 
            process. See skforecast.exceptions.warn_skforecast_categories for more
            information.

        predictions : pandas DataFrame
            Values predicted by the forecaster and their estimated interval.

            - pred: predictions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        residuals : dict
            Dictionary of numpy ndarrays with the residuals of each model in the
            form {step: residuals}. If len(residuals) > 1000, only a random 
            sample of 1000 values are stored.
        append : bool, default `True`
            If `True`, new residuals are added to the once already stored in the
            attribute `out_sample_residuals_`. Once the limit of 1000 values is
            reached, no more values are appended. If False, `out_sample_residuals_`
            is overwritten with the new residuals.
        transform : bool, default `True`
            If `True`, new residuals are transformed using self.transformer_y.
        random_state : int, default `123`
            Sets a seed to the random sampling for reproducible output.
